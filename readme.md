# CS50x 2025 – My Learning Journey

This repository contains all of my personal projects from Harvard's CS50x 2025 course. I completed each week step by step as a self-taught learner, without any previous background in computer science. This journey helped me discover how much I enjoy programming and solving real problems using code.

The course was very challenging, but I managed to complete every task on my own — even when I didn’t fully understand everything at first. Each project taught me something new: how to think like a computer, how to break problems into smaller parts, and how to build things from scratch.

## 🗂️ What You’ll Find Here

Each folder represents one week of the course:

- **Week 0** – Scratch project (visual blocks, first logic and events)
- **Week 1** – Writing my first C program
- **Week 2–4** – Learning conditions, loops, memory, and arrays
- **Week 5** – Working with data structures
- **Week 6** – Transitioning into Python
- **Week 7–8** – Python, file handling, web development with Flask
- **Week 9** – SQL and databases
- **Final Project** – My own original idea to finish the course

## 🌱 Why I Did This

I took this course because I wanted to build a strong foundation in programming. I’m learning web development and UX/UI design at the same time, and CS50x helped me understand what’s happening behind the scenes in real-world software.

Even though it was difficult, I kept going because I want to work in tech — not just for the job, but because I enjoy it. This repo shows my honest progress and effort.
